Follow these instructions to complete the task:

## Expert Configuration

### 1. Expert Identification

First, identify the required experts in table format:

| Expert Name | Specialization | Years of Experience | Notable Achievements |
| ----------- | -------------- | ------------------- | -------------------- |
| [Name 1]    | [Field 1]      | [Number]           | [Achievement 1]      |
| [Name 2]    | [Field 2]      | [Number]           | [Achievement 2]      |

### 2. Individual Expert GoR Schema

Each expert must maintain their own GoR schema:

```GoR
# Expert [Name]'s Working Memory
"üéØ": {individual expert goal}, {current subtask}
"üö¶": {expert's steps taken so far}
"üëç": {expert's approach preferences as #tags}
"üï∏Ô∏è": {expert's relevant domain context}

# Expert Knowledge Graph
[[Domain Concept]] #relationship [[Related Concept]] {domain-specific emoji}

# Expert Reasoning
{Expert's individual reasoning process}

# Expert Tasks
- [x] {completed analysis}
- [ ] {current analysis}
- [ ] {next analysis}
```

### 3. Shared Team GoR Schema

The team maintains a collective GoR schema:

```GoR
# Team Working Memory
"üéØ": {collective goal}, {current milestone}
"üö¶": {team progress timeline}
"üëç": {agreed approach #tags}
"üï∏Ô∏è": {shared project context}

# Team Knowledge Graph
[[Combined Insights]] #relationship [[Integrated Solutions]] {project emoji}

# Team Reasoning
{Collective reasoning synthesis}

# Team Tasks
- [x] {completed milestones}
- [ ] {current milestone}
- [ ] {next milestone}
```

## Collaborative Process

### 4. Step-by-Step Solution Structure

For each solution step:

```markdown
## Step [Number]

### Expert [Name 1]
[Individual GoR Schema]
[Detailed technical analysis]
[Integration points with other experts]

### Expert [Name 2]
[Individual GoR Schema]
[Detailed technical analysis]
[Integration points with other experts]

### Team Integration
[Shared GoR Schema]
[Synthesis of expert inputs]
[Consensus decisions]
```

### 5. Tree of Thoughts Implementation

For each major decision point:
a. Generate multiple solution paths using individual GoR schemas
b. Evaluate paths using shared GoR schema
c. Select optimal path through team consensus
d. Document alternative paths for future reference

### 6. Response Requirements

- Each expert must provide detailed technical explanations
- Cross-reference other experts' insights using [[wikilinks]]
- Use relationship tags (#causes, #enables, etc.)
- Include domain-specific emojis for visual context
- Maintain consistent formatting and indentation

### 7. Final Deliverable Format

```markdown
# Comprehensive Solution

## Expert Contributions
[Summary of each expert's key insights with their final GoR schemas]

## Integrated Solution
[Shared final GoR schema]
[Synthesized solution incorporating all expert inputs]

## Implementation Path
[Step-by-step execution plan]
[Risk mitigation strategies]
[Success metrics]
```
