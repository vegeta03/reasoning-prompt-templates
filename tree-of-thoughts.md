Simulate a group of brilliant experts with exceptional logical thinking skills working collaboratively to provide a solution to a task using the tree of thoughts method. Your goal is to provide a comprehensive and well-structured response to the given task.

Here is the task to be completed:

# Task
{{TASK}}

Follow these instructions to complete the task:

## 1. Expert Identification

Identify the required number of experts with different specializations needed to complete the task with in-depth and detailed solution. Present this information in a markdown table format as follows:

```markdown
| Expert Name | Specialization | Years of Experience | Notable Achievements |
| ----------- | -------------- | ------------------- | -------------------- |
| [Name 1]    | [Field 1]      | [Number]            | [Achievement 1]      |
| [Name 2]    | [Field 2]      | [Number]            | [Achievement 2]      |
| ...         | ...            | ...                 | ...                  |
```

## 2. Collaborative Thinking Process Structure

Format the collaborative thinking process using the following structure:

```markdown
## Step 1

### [Expert Name 1]
[Detailed explanation of thought process, considering and building upon previous and current contributions]

### [Expert Name 2]
[Detailed explanation of thought process, considering and building upon previous and current contributions]

...

## Step 2

...
```

## 3. Collaborative Thinking Process

For each step of the thinking process:
- Introduce each expert using their name (e.g., [Name 1], [Name 2], etc.).
- Have each expert verbosely write down one step of their thinking.
- Experts should share their thoughts with the group.
- In subsequent steps, experts should consider the prior and current explanations of others and refine or build upon the thoughts of their colleagues.
- Experts should openly acknowledge any mistakes they make.

## 4. Tree of Thoughts Method

Implement the tree of thoughts method as follows:
a. Generate multiple thought paths for solving the problem.
b. Evaluate the promise of each path.
c. Expand on the most promising thoughts.
d. Backtrack if necessary and explore alternative paths.

## 5. Response Formatting

Format your response as follows:
a. Use step-by-step numbering for each round of thoughts.
b. Clearly label each expert's contribution (e.g., [Name 1], [Name 2], ..., [Name n]).
c. Include in-depth and detailed technical information in each expert's explanation, showcasing their exceptional logical thinking skills.
d. Use appropriate indentation and line breaks for readability.

## 6. Continuation and Completion

Continue this process, incrementing the step number, until a definitive solution is reached. Ensure that each expert's contribution is in-depth, detailed, and technical, showcasing their exceptional logical thinking skills.

## 7. Final Solution

Provide a comprehensive summary of the collaborative solution in the following format:

```markdown
# Final Solution

[Comprehensive summary of the solution, incorporating key insights from all experts]
```

Remember to maintain a high level of technical detail and logical rigour throughout the entire process, befitting the expertise of these brilliant thinkers. Begin your simulation by introducing the experts and starting the collaborative thinking process.
